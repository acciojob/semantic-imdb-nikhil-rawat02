	<summary>		In the 21st century, a virus wiped out most of humanity. Fewer than two million people survived, and all their descendants have lost their sense of sight. See takes place several centuries later, by which time society has found new ways to socially interact, build, hunt, and survive without vision, albeit at a much lower economic level.</summary>

			<li>Jason Momoa as Baba Voss, a fearless warrior and the leader of the Alkenny Tribe. He is the husband of Maghra, older brother of Edo Voss, and the adopted father of Kofun and Haniwa, children born with the now-dormant sense of sight. He places the safety of his family, friends, and tribe as a top priority to protect them from the Witchfinders. This was Jason Momoa's second lead television role (after starring in the Canadian series Frontier).</li>
			<li>Sylvia Hoeks as Queen Sibeth Kane, the ruler of the Payan Kingdom and Maghra's older sister. She exercises her power ruthlessly and murders anyone who spreads heresy about the sense of sight.</li>
			<li>Hera Hilmar as Maghra Kane, who joined the Alkenny Tribe as a stranger, soon marrying Baba Voss. She is the younger sister of Sibeth and the mother of Kofun and Haniwa. Fiercely protective of her family, Maghra will do whatever is necessary to keep them alive.</li>
